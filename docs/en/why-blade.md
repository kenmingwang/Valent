title: Why Blade?
---

Blade is a name that was inadvertently started in September 2015 with the goal of providing individual developers with an alternative to the Spring series framework.

Learning Blade Building a Web application takes only 1 hour. If you are a veteran of Web development, maybe `20` minutes is enough.

## What is Blade ?

1. An efficient MVC development framework
2. Is a library with its own WebServer
3. Help developers quickly build web applications
4. The source code is less than the open source framework of `500KB`
5. Simple and elegant `API`
6. Good code abstraction and thinking collision
7. What do you think is what?

> In general, Blade is an open source framework that helps you quickly build a Web application. Its code is simple, elegant, and the API works well.
> If you are willing to read the code, it will not take you long.

So the question is, **Blade is not what?**

1. Not a product under the J2EE system (that is, not following the Servlet specification)
2. Not a family bucket (it is responsible for the perimeter of the Web, but more extensions need to be implemented on their own)
